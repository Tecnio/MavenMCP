# Maven MCP

Maven MCP is a framework for using MCP with maven. Previous MavenMCP used Strezzed/strezz-central but was taken down and a new account named Mason Khonsari which is most likely Kant taking control of the account so in order to not have any security risks I have forked MavenMCP and migrated it to Hexeptions repos.
